Kiwi Test is a simple library that contains a variety of testing utilities that we have found useful over time in
various projects.

Almost all the dependencies in the POM have _provided_ scope, so that we don't bring in a ton of required dependencies.
This downside to this is that you must specifically add any required dependencies to your own POM in order to use a
specific feature in Kiwi Test.

The only required dependencies are guava, kiwi, and slf4j-api. Note that kiwi also marks most dependencies as
_provided_ scope, so in some cases you might need to add additional dependencies.
